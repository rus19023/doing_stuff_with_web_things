          <h3>Keep Layers Separate </h3>
          <p>
            "It is widely considered best practice to separate the concerns of each layer, so each layer is only responsible for one thing. Putting them altogether can lead to very complicated pages where all of the code is mixed up together in one file, causing ‘tag soup’ or ‘code spaghetti’".

          <h3>Lose Frustration</h3>
          <p>
            Remove unnecessary interaction/taps/clicks. Automate things that users don't really need to do for themselves. Put them in archives where they can get them if they need/want to later. (example: expired boarding passes auto-archived)
          </p>
          <h3>Speed</h3>
          <p>
            If you must use a non-SVG image, be sure to optimize it and lazy load it. .webp are very small files, yet great quality images. I don't recall this being mentioned in the course, but I have used this principle before in web design classes. <br>

          <h3>Reachability </h3>
          <p>
            Make anything clickable/tappable appear in the easy to reach areas of one-handed thumbs. See image: bright green area is best. <br>

          <h3>Forms</h3>
          <p>
            Float labels, taller inputs, bigger checkbox/radio button, only get the contact info for preferred: email or phone, with phone, only need number, email, need textarea to collect the info you need, such as quote for what?
            <br><br>
            Enable autocomplete, save prior inputs, Show passwords, but give “eye” option to hide it.
            <br><br>
            Card info: use same field that auto advances through the stages of info needed, card# first (auto space like on card for easier readability), then expiration, ccv, zipcode. Use number pad for entering numbers! <br>

          </p>
          <h3>Ads</h3>
          <p>
            No popups!  No ads “above the fold” unless they are unobtrusive. Stationary ad in background with small window to show through. <br>
