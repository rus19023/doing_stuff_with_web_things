          Write a 5-10 position page paper, which in addition to the requirements below, focuses on maximizing telemetry and reducing technical debt.

          1.  corporate data warehouse [or data mart?]
          2. Explain when you should use Inmon or Kimball methods for your data marts and 
          warehouses.
          3. Provide perspective (agree, disagree or provided alternative) with the statement that 
          “embedded structures, tables, and documents, like JSON, are big data elements, and almost 
          always require ETL processes to simplify their structures”
          4. Define how would you go about selecting an analytical tool for the corporation; consider 
          analytical programming but avoid where possible (due to high technical debt) when other 
          tool sets can met needs effectively at low cost (like MicroStrategy, Tableau, Microsoft Power 
          BI, etc.)
          5. Explain how you would qualify big data 6. Qualify how the selected seven aspects of data 
          analysis (identified further below) work [with] various data sources, specifically
          a. Relational or object relational database management systems.
          b. NoSQL (Not only SQL) database management systems, like Cassandra and 
          MongoDB.
          c. XML raw files and database managed documents.

          <h3 class="padhead title">Analytical tool:</h3>
           In context of this paper, the assumption is that “analytical tool” refers to the end-to-end analytics platform, specifically:
           <ul>
              <li>
                  Database layer for data storage and processing
              </li>
              <li>
                  ETL/ELT for data acquisition and integration
              </li>
              <li>
                  Presentation layer for user access, visualization and analytics
              </li>
              <li>
                  Presentation layer for user access, visualization and analytics
              </li>
           </ul>

          <h3 class="padhead title">IT telemetry: </h3>
          “the automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible 
          sources to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis” (source).
          Technical debt: “the extra [future] development work that arises when code that is easy to 
          implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.” (source)

          <h2 class="padhead title">7 Aspects of Data Analysis</h2>
          <h3 class="padhead title"></h3>
           Data Visualization: “Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and 
          data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide 
          an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. In the world 
          of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive 
          amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.” (source)
          
          <h3 class="padhead title">Analytics:</h3>
            “The field of data analysis. Analytics often involves studying past historical data to 
          research potential trends, to analyze the effects of certain decisions or events, or to 
          evaluate the performance of a given tool or scenario. The goal of analytics is to improve the 
          business by gaining knowledge which can be used to make improvements or changes.“ 
          (source)
          
          <h3 class="padhead title">Online Analytical Processing (OLAP):</h3>
            “...enables end-users to perform ad hoc analysis of data 
          in multiple dimensions, thereby providing the insight and understanding they need for 
          better decision making [by providing the] ability to create very fast aggregations and 
          calculations of underlying data sets.” (source) · Document Management: “a document-
          oriented database contains documents, which are records that describe the data in the 
          document, as well as the actual data; one or more document [can be used] to represent a 
          real-world object.” (source) · 
          <h3 class="padhead title">Decision Services:</h3>
           see note
           Integrations: “To integrate data across mixed application environments, you need to get 
          data from one data environment (source) to another data environment (destination). 
          <h3 class="padhead title"></h3>
          Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) technologies have been used to accomplish this in traditional data warehouse environments.” (source)
          <h3 class="padhead title"></h3>
           Big Data Integration: “...differs from traditional data integration in many dimensions: 
          Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity, which are the big data main characteristics” (source)
