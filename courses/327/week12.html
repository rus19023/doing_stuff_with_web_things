                  Write a 5-10 position page paper, which in addition to the requirements below, focuses on maximizing telemetry and reducing technical debt.
                  <br><br>
                  The goal of this final project is to perform an analysis of the data warehouse to support CIO-level decision-making.
                  <br><br>
                  The idea is that you will be looking at the parts of the data warehouse model below (not including those boxes that are not filled in with blue).

                  "The data requirements analysis process employs a top-down approach that emphasizes business-driven needs, so the analysis is conducted to ensure the identified requirements are relevant and feasible. The process incorporates data discovery and assessment in the context of explicitly qualified business data consumer needs. Having identified the data requirements, candidate data sources are determined and their quality is assessed using the data quality assessment process described in chapter 11."

                  "Data visualization (or ‘data viz’) is one of the most important aspects of data analytics. Mapping raw data using graphical elements is great for aiding pattern-spotting and it’s useful for sharing findings in an easily digestible, eye-catching way. And while the priority should always be the integrity of your data, if done well, data visualization can also be a lot of fun.
                  Master the art of data viz and you’ll soon be spotting trends and correlations, all while flexing your creative muscle."

They then present these insights in the form of visualizations, such as graphs and charts, so that stakeholders can understand and act upon them. The kinds of insights gleaned from the data depends on the type of analysis performed. There are four main types of analysis used by data experts: Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. Descriptive analytics looks at what happened in the past, while diagnostic analytics looks at why it might have happened. Predictive and prescriptive analytics consider what is likely to happen in the future and, based on these predictions, what the best course of action might be."

Research shows that nearly 70 percent of U.S. executives say they will prefer job candidates with data skills by 2021, and the demand for analysts will only grow as we continue to digitize our physical world.
                If you’re just starting your research and are wondering how to make the transition to a career in data analytics, you’re not alone. Scanning job postings for data-driven positions is a great starting point, but many analyst roles are highly nuanced, making it difficult to discern which skills are the most necessary to invest in.""
