            What would you use XSLT for in the ETL process?
        </h3>
        <p class="normal-text padleft">
          eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is a language tool that works with XML documents to create other documents. These new documents can be transformed from one XML style to another, or from XML to other types of documents, such as HTML, XSL Formatting Objects, plain text. Using other tools along with XSLT the creation an even greater variety of documents, including PDF, PostScript and PNG documents can be accomplished.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text padleft">
            The original XML documents are retained, while the conversion into new documents takes place. This conversion process takes place with REGEX (regular expressions), text-based matching and XSL stylesheets to gather patterns and replace them with the desired format.

            What is the difference between an XML data source and an XML datatype in a relational data source?  
        </h3>
        <p class="normal-text padleft">
            XML documents are data sources when data is being extracted directly from them. Relational databases like Oracle, Postgre and MySQL can store data in columns with a built-in data type of XML Type. These databases also have built-in functions, such as CAST or CONVERT that assist in transforming the data held in these XML columns to other data types.
        </p>        

        <h3 class="padhead title">
          How would this impact your ETL?
        </h3>
        <p class="normal-text padleft">
            XML and XSLT, along with XML data types in traditional databases are used to transform raw data into useable formats for the enterprise's needs. When data is converted from XML into HTML, for example, a webpage or pages can be created for sales reps to view their daily, weekly, monthly and yearly sales reports. Another example could be insurance companies using XSLT to transform their actuarial data into tables and columns in Oracle to create a quote and policy details for a new client.

            What is XPath and how does it relate to XSLT?
        </h3>
        <p class="normal-text padleft">
            XPath is a way to navigate through XML documents, in any direction necessary. It is helpful in software development and testing. Using XPath, a developer will be able to locate nodes. There are seven basic XPath nodes:
            <ul>
              <li class="normal-text">
                  Element nodes
              </li>
              <li class="normal-text">
                  Attribute nodes
              </li>
              <li class="normal-text">
                  Text nodes
              </li>
              <li class="normal-text">
                  Comment nodes
              </li>
              <li class="normal-text">
                  Namespaces
              </li>
              <li class="normal-text">
                  Processing instructions
              </li>
              <li class="normal-text">
                  Root nodes
              </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text padleft">
            Operators of types similar to programming languages allow for functions checking a huge variety of conditions, such as greater than, equal to, boolean and math applications for manipulating and comparing data.

            Summary
        </h3>
        <p class="normal-text padleft">
            The development of XML databases has made inroads on the complexity of retrieving, transforming and storing XML data in data marts, warehouses and lakes. Many new applications, such as MarkLogic, have added layers of code compatible with many other tools to create an almost complete out-of-the-box, flexible and cost-effective solution for the issues of huge collections of data that needs parsing, summarizing, manipulating, formatting and outputting to create user reports, on screens or printed hardcopies. They can handle huge, nested documents, but also large numbers of documents. The flexible XML data model, like MongoDB's JSON-type document model, also makes them highly scalable. Another similarity and great feature is the ability to handle schema changes on-the-fly like MongoDB and other JSON-based document stores. XML data stores are an excellent way to manage large and/or complicated collections of data documents in XML format, and for transforming and transporting raw data for use in data warehouses.
