                    With your paper, your focus is to understand what complexity having a schemaless database brings.  My expectations for the paper are that you cover the following questions:
                    <br><br>
                    What is a schemaless collection in MongoDB?
                    Schema-on-write vs. Schema-on-read and Schemaless databases

                    If you have a MongoDB source feeding into your data warehouse and an individual field value changes, what is the downstream impact?  What is the downstream impact if the schema of new documents in your collection changes?  How do these downstream considerations impact your technical debt?  How do they impact your telemetry?

                <h3>What is a schemaless collection in MongoDB?</h3>
                <p class="normal-text">
                  A schema is a well-defined, structured description of each part of a traditional database. This requires rigid formatting to maintain data consistency.​

                  ​
                  
                  Schema-less means the schema/model is not required before writing data, but is needed when the data is read, so the data can be translated into what is needed in the warehouse.​
                  
                  ​
                  
                  MongoDB does a more natural mapping of data with its JSON-style BSON (binary JSON) documents, so it does not need such structure or definition beforehand. This is what allows for more outward scalability and flexibility in adding fields and nesting levels for the data store.​

                <h3>How do you update data in MongoDB?  What happens when an individual field or field value in a document changes?</h3>
                <p class="normal-text">
                    When a field or field value is changed in MongoDB, the whole document must be re-written to include the new data. This means that the whole document and any embedded documents must be held in memory until the update is complete. This could cause a performance problem if the update is large. The good thing is that each document has a maximum size of 16MB. This means that if you have a large update, you can update the document in chunks.

                <p class="normal-text">
                    Note: Sometimes the question of whether MongoDB as a source, or Redis as a source, or ElasticSearch as a source, or Cassandra as a source, or Neo4J as a source ... is good or bad is irrelevant.  The question from a data warehouse perspective is more about given that we have a MongoDB/Redis/ElasticSearch/Cassandra/Neo4J database, how do we minimize or manage the technical debt associated with getting it into the data warehouse?  And how do we take away the complexity of integration from the end-user and present them with something that is highly usable and consistent?
