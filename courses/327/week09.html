                <p class="normal-text padleft">
                    A schema is a well-defined, structured description of each part of a traditional database. This requires rigid formatting to maintain data consistency and read speed.
                  
                    MongoDB does a more natural mapping of data with its JSON-style BSON (binary JSON) documents, so it does not need definition beforehand.
                  
                    MongoDB's containers for document objects are called collections. A collection is a group of documents that share a common theme, and can be compared to a traditional database table.  
                </p>

                <h3 class="padhead title">
                    Schema-on-write vs. Schema-on-read and Schemaless databases
                </h3>
                <p class="normal-text padleft">
                    Schema-on-write is the process of defining the structure of a database before writing data. 
                    
                    This provides for quick results, as the data is already formattted for the most part. 
                    
                    This is great for repetitive reports, but not for agility in the whole system.
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text padleft">
                    In Schema-on-read means the structure of a database is defined when data is read. This gives more agility and capacity for scaling out, but the speed takes a hit. 
                    
                    Schemaless means the schema/model is not required before writing data, but is needed when the data is read, so the data can be translated into what is needed in the warehouse.
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text padleft">
                    Schemaless databases can handle both structured and unstructured data.

                    This is what allows for more outward scalability and flexibility in adding fields and nesting up to 100 levels for the data store.
                </p>

                    How do you update data in MongoDB?
                </h3>
                <p class="normal-text padleft">                     
                    Updates in MongoDB are done using object methods, finding the id numbers created by the system when the documents are created.

                    When a field or field value is changed in MongoDB, the whole document must be "upserted" to include the new data. 
                    
                    This means that the whole document and any embedded documents must be held in memory until the update is complete. 
                    
                    Each document has a maximum size of 16MB. This could cause a performance problem if the document has many nested dependents.
                </p>

                <h3 class="padhead title">
                <p class="normal-text padleft">
                    Telemetry readings can be used to decide whether to scale up (need more resources for single machine) or out (need more nodes added to the database network).
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text padleft">
                    Using MongoDB, it is easier to mitigate the issue of heavily nested document collections using all the resources. With sharding, the data can be written and read across few or many nodes. This means that if there is a huge update, the document or collection can be updated in chunks. 
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text padleft">
                    Also, MongoDB makes it easier to migrate from a traditional database or export to a data warehouse due to the object orientation of the system. Using the application's code, bridges can be built using the built-in mapping capabilities of MongoDB to create data cubes to serve the end-users' needs.
