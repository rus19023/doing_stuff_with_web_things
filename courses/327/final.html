                <p class="normal-text">
                    This paper is to share concepts I have learned about Big Data Analysis and Warehousing, and the accompanying Technology, Methodology and the available Tools and Techniques.
                    With the massive numbers of available tools, frameworks, libraries, databases, companies and corporations, developers, techniques, data sources and other resources available today, all of which is increasing at rocket speed, managing Big Data is a colossal issue.

                <h4 class="title">Big Data</h4>
                    <p class="normal-text">
                        Big Data elements are "extremely large" datasets, including JSON or XML document-based collections or embedded structures of up to 100 nested container levels, spreadsheets, wide columnar tables or relational database tables of millions of rows, or any combination of these types of data sources.
                        <br><br>
                        There are many ways to analyze Big Data using the above-mentioned resources that to filter, summarize, and detect outliers, trends, patterns and cycles. These necessary procedures enable business decisions to be made correctly, due to the varied types of sources that are collected needing to be formatted, summarized and/or normalized through ETL or ELT processes.

                        The National Institute of Standards and Technology issued a report defining Big Data as “extensive datasets—primarily in the characteristics of volume, velocity, and/or variability—that require a scalable architecture for efficient storage, manipulation, and analysis.” <a href="#bigdata">[source]</a>
                        <br><br>
                        Big Data has also been defined as an amount of data that exceeds a petabyte, which is a million gigabytes.

                        When is Big Data contained in a Data Mart or Data Warehouse?

                    <p class="normal-text">
                        Data Marts contain data for one specific business purpose. These repositories are usually containers of summarized data ready to be analyzed for said business purpose.
                        <br><br>
                        Data Warehouses may contain various Data Marts, and each of these marts will serve a different purpose in the overall corporate plan. Following is a topical comparison of Data Marts vs. Data Warehouses. Please note that these are generalizations and some actual systems may differ from these details.

                Which model to use when: Inmon or Kimball?
            </p>

            <p class="normal-text">
                The Inmon Model (snowflake schema) is best suited for the largest collections of data in Data Warehouses. They are not the fastest type of system to set up, they take many months of planning, setting up infrastructure, data collection, selecting the best tools to use to produce the results for the specific needs of the end users. This model takes advantage of horizontal scaling to handle the heavy burden of all the data spread across many nodes or computers.

            <p class="normal-text">
                The Kimball Model (star schema) works best for Data Marts with smaller data collections. They can be set up fairly quickly, and are must less costly, which helps smaller enterprises keep a lower budget. This model works well with vertical scaling.

            <h3 class="title">Data Transformation</h3>

               <p class="normal-text">
                When designing a system for a Data Warehouse that needs to be spread out, tools like Cassandra (a NoSQL database), Hadoop and MapReduce will help significantly. They are created to support multiple programming languages for any custom query needs, and for horizontal scaling across many nodes. Some of many other tools, frameworks and libraries used for storing data, ETL (Extract Transform Load) or its sister ELT (Extract Load Transform) use different algorithms and infrastructures, such as document-driven databases (MongoDB, CSV or XML documents, spreadsheets), traditional relational databases (Oracle, AWS) and column-oriented databases (Redis, HBase) and cloud-based completely managed systems as a service (RedShift, Azure).

            <h3 class="title">Data Analysis</h3>
              
                <p class="normal-text">
                    Once data sources are collated, they must be processed to draw out the insights hidden in the ocean of bits and bytes. Descriptive analytics is viewing past events' data. Diagnostic analytics finds out why the events may have happened. Predictive analytics are for viewing future events. Prescriptive analytics facilitate future decisions based on these predictions.
              </p>
                <h4 class="title">Data Visualization</h4>
                <p class="normal-text">
                    Data visualization will facilitate finding outliers, trends, cycles, anomalies and other points of interest for making the big business decisions. It is much more difficult to see patterns in tables of numbers that don't seem to make any sense, but having colors, lines, bars, circles, bubble and other visual aids make the patterns, or lack of patterns, pop out. Here a few samples of data visual aids:

                <p class="normal-text">
                   Technical debt is the name given to previously unforeseen issues that cause extra financial and time costs, including salaries for developers and loss of respect from clients if the system is not available as contracted or there is downtime.
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text">
                      When it comes to software development, technical debt is the idea that certain necessary work gets delayed during the development of a software project in order to hit a deliverable or deadline.
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text">
                    There are many reasons why technical debt exists:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="normal-text">
                        Poorly designed infrastructure
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text">
                        Deviation from business rules/principles
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text">
                        Poor or no design standards and patterns
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text">
                        Little or no testing
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text">
                        Constant or frequent variations of business rules and requirements or incoming data traffic patterns
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="normal-text">
                    Integration of data collections with tools, frameworks and libraries to process them can have heavy technical debt. Using the MEAN stack with JavaScript developers on staff, this can be mitigated, as the MEAN stack is based on JavaScript and many tools support JavaScript.
                </p>
            

            <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
                
                <p class="normal-text">        

                    Planning is tantamount for any successful system. To select the correct tools, both financial and time costs must be taken into consideration. Consistent telemetry measurements over time can be analyzed using the same methods to control technical debt and budget costs. Custom integrations should only be used if no other tools can provide the results needed for the business purpose(s).

                </p>
                <p class="normal-text">
                    Finding the right tools to give the best final results can be daunting. However, there is some advantage to using cloud systems over on-premise, as the cost in both technical debt and financial are more affordable with managed systems in the cloud. On-premise solutions will generally include a much higher technical and financial budget due to the heavy personnel needs to maintain all the equipment and software. JavaScript-trained developers can use the MEAN stack to provide customized solutions with less technical debt and possibly no added financial burden, as all the components are open-source.
