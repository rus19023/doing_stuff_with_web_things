                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p class="normal-text padit">
                    Many people who want to study the gospel of Jesus Christ don't have easy access to tools that help them learn the gospel principles quickly. Some of these people are LDS, and they remember the Scripture Chase from Seminary, but there is no such thing once they are out of Seminary.
                </p>
                <h2 id="todos" class="centered">
                    The Solution
                </h2>
                <p class="normal-text padit">Scripture chase, in digital form! I know it already exists, but as a paid option. I don't believe in making money from anything Gospel-related (priestcraft comes to mind?), so my app will be free. Not even any ads! App will have disclaimer that it is not an official church app with appropriate links to official webpages.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>
                    App Title: Scripture Chase
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    App Description:
                </h4>
                <p class="normal-text padit">
                    Using quiz style or flashcards that flip (in practice or quiz mode), and possibly scrambled scriptures to put in correct order, anyone can study and memorize King James version Bible and other LDS scriptures that teach basic gospel doctrine, just like in LDS Seminary classes.
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text padit">
                    The app will start with the user viewing a home screen, with "What do you want to study?" followed by a list of the 4 units with thumbnail images and options to select all options. The bottom nav buttons will have text and icons: HOME, QUIZ, FLIPCARD, CUSTOMIZE and SETTINGS.
                    <br> <br>
                    If they wish to create and save preferences, they tap the CUSTOMIZE button, and a login screen asking for username and password show. If they don't have an account, in the login screen they can create one, after which they will be asked to login. Once logged in, the Dashboard screen will show, with bottom nav buttons of HOME, QUIZ, FLASHCARDS, XXX and LOGOUT.
                    <br> <br>
                    If they wish to return to the home screen, they tap the HOME button.
                    <br> <br>
                    Then it will go to a main menu where they can start recording a journal entry, have it sent to the API to be transcribed, receive the journal transcription text, save it to a file, store that file in their journal file system. If time permits, the app will also have a delete function for files, flag function for special entries, printing options and off-site storage options (such as cloud storage like OneDrive, computer hard drive, usb etc.).. <br> <br>
