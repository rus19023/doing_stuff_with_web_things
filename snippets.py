    In this project, you'll create a program that calculates the total
    cost of a customers shopping basket, including shipping.

    - If a customer spends over $100, they get free shipping
    - If a customer spends < $100, the shipping cost is $1.20 per kg of the baskets weight

    Print the customers total basket cost (including shipping) to complete this exercise.

    In this project, you'll create a program that that tells
    you when the value of your Bitcoin falls below $30,000.

    You will need to:
    - Create a function to convert Bitcoin to USD
    - If your Bitcoin falls below $30,000, print a message.

    You can assume that 1 Bitcoin is worth $40,000

# 1) write a function to calculate bitcoin to usd

# 2) use function to calculate if the investment is below $30,000

# 3) change bitcoin to usd to 24,999 and re-test the function
