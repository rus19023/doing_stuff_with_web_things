          In addition, you have a paper about how MongoDB stores and provides access to data and how that will impact ongoing maintenance and utilization of the data. 
          <br><br>
          The expectation on this is your craft your response to the manager in a way that it represents two groups who are impacted by the decision of incorporating data from MongoDB into the data warehouse.
          <br><br><br>
          Group 1 - Database Management / DevOps
          <br><br>
          What is the impact of using a database like MongoDB?  
          How is the data stored and what types of challenges will administrators need to deal with in managing this environment?
          What will be the key considerations in transforming and loading data from the MongoDB environment into a relational database (RDBMS)?
          <br><br><br>
          Group 2 - Developers (Node.js) <br><br>
          How will developers, who are using the MongoDB database, access the data? <br><br>
          What challenges will they face in working with the data in the MongoDB database? <br><br>
           
          
          My hope is that, as you are working through this set of hypothetical case studies associated with your papers, you are starting to get a sense of how to craft your messages to your manager in such a way that the advice can be acted upon. 
          <br><br>
          This is meant to be a simulation of the process that teams go through as they make architectural decisions, identifying the pros and cons of each alternative and looking at who will be impacted by the decision and how.  Learning this skill will be essential in your career as you will play many different roles on the team with a single goal of providing a solid and easy-to-manage solution.
