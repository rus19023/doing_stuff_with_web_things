                    Near the end of the first semester of my sophomore year, I stumbled upon the CSA, and started joining their zoom meetings. I quickly became interested in cyber security, and decided to change my grad plan. We only need 3 certificates total for a degree, but I wanted a well-rounded plan. There are security concerns for each of these areas: Web Front End, Web Back End, System Administration, Databases and Computer Programming, so I decided to obtain all of those certificates offered by BYU-Idaho, in lieu of a cyber security degree, which is not offered (not now, but hopefully in the future?). I proceeded to work toward the goals of completing these certificates, and the courses that led me to them are listed here.
